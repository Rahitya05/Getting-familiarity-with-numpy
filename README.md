# Getting-familiarity-with-numpy
This repository contains code and examples demonstrating the fundamental concepts and functionalities of NumPy, a core library for numerical computing in Python. The code showcases various features of NumPy, including array manipulation, mathematical operations, data aggregation, and transformation techniques.

### Features:

#### Array Creation: 
Examples of creating arrays from lists, ranges, and custom shapes.
#### Mathematical Operations: 
Demonstrations of basic and advanced mathematical functions, including element-wise operations and linear algebra.
#### Indexing and Slicing: 
Techniques for accessing and modifying array elements, including advanced and boolean indexing.
#### Data Aggregation: 
Usage of statistical functions to compute mean, median, standard deviation, and sums.
#### Data Transformation: 
Methods for reshaping, resizing, concatenating, and splitting arrays.
#### Real-World Applications: 
Examples of NumPy in scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and engineering.
